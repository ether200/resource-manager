## How To Use

When you open the app for the first time you'll be invited to either login or register. Notice how the form values are being validated before the form is being submitted thanks to React-Hook-Form.

As soon as you login or register you'll be redirected to the main page where you can start creating a subject by clicking on the top left of the navbar and opening the sidebar. You can't have subjects with the same name.

Once you make the subject and click on it, you can perform all the CRUD operations on each resource.
